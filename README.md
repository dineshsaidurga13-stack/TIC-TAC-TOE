# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java. It allows two players to play alternately on a 3x3 grid. The program checks for winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals. It also detects when the game ends in a draw. This project demonstrates the use of loops, arrays, conditions, and logical thinking in Java programming.
